# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I was introduced to coding when I was in my 9th standard and from the beginning it was very fascinating. I realised that I loved doing coding and therefore, I wanted to improve my skills and abilty in the programming area. I started learning myself through Youtube and other courses. It was quite difficult initially because I would forget the things that I learned after some days and eventually I was not making much improvements. Next time onwards, instead of watching and following the videos I decided to try problems related to the concepts that I just learned. This method worked out and I started to understand everything and I slowly improved. After I joined Amrita, I heard about amFOSS through induction. It was at that moment that I decided that this club is perfecct for me and the people in the club would guide me right path. I hope I will get a step closer to acheive my goal by joining the club.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
After doing all these tasks, I have got a pretty much idea about everything and therefore, I can deicde that what should I focus upon. I love competitive programming and development. So, I would spent my time solving problems of programming from websites like hackerrank and also I wouold try to learn development softwares like flutter. I will find at least 2 hrs everyday for the improvements that I can make in these fields.
### How would you contribute back to the club?
I can assure that I will be whole heartedly do everything within my limits. I will also try to achieve targets that the club want from me by wiining competitions.
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Personally, I found the selection process very interesting as it allowed everyone to explore every field that the club offers. Also, the time given by the club was enough to learn and do a task. All the tasks were moderately difficult. Overall, the selection process was excellent.
