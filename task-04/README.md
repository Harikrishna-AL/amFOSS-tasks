# Python CLI app
Honestly, by seeing 'NASA', 'Rovers' and "MARS' I got a little scared and left the task to do it in the end. I started it again by reffering to some sites about API and CLI and this time I felt that it was not as hard as it seemed. After going through some errors, I finally created the CLI app. I was excited fot this task as I had never created a command Line app before.
