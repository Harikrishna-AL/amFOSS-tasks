# My views on the tasks
Personally, I thought that the tasks were very interesting as it contained each and every filed that students would be interested upon. I think this gave us an idea that how each and every fields and softwares would look like and that gave us a clear perspective. Apart from that the tasks were moderately difficult. They were pretty doable. Even though I didn't know the process for all the tasks, 1 month was enoguh for me to learn the basics and do it.

# Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is Harikrisshna Pillai. I have been fascinated to coding for a long time. Therefore, I feel that amFOSS would be a right place to develop my skills and knowledge with much better opportunities. I am a pretty much average in coding. I only knew python to a certain extent, but after doing the tasks I know the basics of other languages as well. After a month of doing the tasks, I feel completely different than before. I feel that my knowledge about coding ang development has leveled up and it was completely worth tbe time.
