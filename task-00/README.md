# Installing Ubuntu

At first when I started doing the amFOSS tasks, I had a laptop which had a little storage remaining. Therefore, I decided to install ubuntu terminal in windows so that i could use all the necessary commands needed for the tasks. Installing that was easy and I completed it without any errors. Now, I have bought a new laptop. So I will installing ubuntu in it.
